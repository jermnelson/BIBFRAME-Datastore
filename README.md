# BIBFRAME Datastore Project
The BIBFRAME Datastore project is a core component of the [Catalog Pull Platform][CPP]. This
project contains [Fedora][FC], [Elastic Search][ES], and 
[Fuskei][FS] configuration information and documentation for running a Linked Data
platform supporting such projects as 
Library of Congress sponsered, [bibcat](http://bibcat.org) with the code repository [here](https://github.com/jermnelson/bibframe-catalog) 
and Colorado College's [TIGER Catalog](https://github.com/Tutt-Library/tiger-catalog).

You must use the [Semantic Server](https://github.com/jermnelson/semantic-server.git), a cloud REST API front-end, with the BIBFRAME datastore.
