# BIBFRAME Datastore Project
The BIBFRAME Datastore project is a core component of the [Catalog Pull Platform][CPP]. This
project contains [Fedora][FC], [Elastic Search][ES], and 
[Fuskei][FS] configuration information and documentation for running a Linked Data
platform supporting such projects as 
Library of Congress sponsered, [BIBFRAME Search and Display Catalog](https://github.com/jermnelson/bibframe-catalog)
and Colorado College's [TIGER Catalog](https://github.com/Tutt-Library/tiger-catalog).

It is highly recommended that you use the [Semantic Server](https://github.com/jermnelson/semantic-server.git),
a cloud REST API front-end, to the BIBFRAME datastore.
